Welcome to the Recipe App! This application comes with a robust authentication and authorization system. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Install Node Modules:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of both the front-end and back-end files. In each directory, run the command `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.

2. Set Up VS Code:
   Ensure you have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) installed on your computer. Open the application and load both the front-end and back-end directories into separate VS Code windows.

3. Front-end Setup:
   In the front-end directory, you will find all the necessary files related to the user interface of the Recipe App. Make any required customizations or styling changes as per your preferences.

4. Back-end Setup:
   The back-end directory contains the server-side logic and API endpoints. Modify any configurations, such as database settings or authentication methods, to suit your requirements.

5. Database Configuration:
   If your application requires a database, make sure it is properly set up and configured. Connect the back-end to the database by modifying the appropriate settings.

6. Authentication and Authorization:
   Implement the authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure user access to the app's features. You can use libraries like Passport.js, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), or any other preferred method to handle user authentication.

7. Run the Application:
   Once all the configurations and customizations are complete, it's time to start the application. In both the front-end and back-end directories, run `npm start` in the terminal to launch the app.

8. Test the App:
   Open your web browser and access the application's URL. If everything was set up correctly, you should see the Recipe App's user interface. Log in or register to experience the full functionality, and make sure the authentication and authorization processes work as expected.

That's it! You now have a Recipe App with authentication and authorization capabilities up and running. Happy cooking and enjoy using your app! If you encounter any issues, feel free to refer to the documentation or seek assistance from the development community.
